# Find Longest Bitonic Subarray in an array

The longest bitonic subarray problem is to find a subarray of a given sequence in which the subarrayâ€™s elements are first sorted in
in increasing order, then in decreasing order, and the subarray is as long as possible.
Strictly ascending or descending subarrays are also accepted.
