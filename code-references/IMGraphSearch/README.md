# Graph Search, DFS and BFS

** DFS **
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a source node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Depth-first search can be used on both directed and undirected graphs.

** BFS **
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a source node and explores the immediate neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

Breadth-first search can be used on both directed and undirected graphs.
